how would I download MVP rankings for each year
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The nflverse package doesn't have a direct function to download MVP rankings as it mainly focuses on play-by-play, team, player stats, and game data. However, you can still gather MVP-related data by leveraging player statistics or using external sources.

Here’s how you might approach the problem:

Using Player Statistics
You can use player statistics as a proxy to identify top-performing players each year and infer MVP rankings.

Example Code to Gather Player Statistics by Year
R
Copy code
# Load the nflverse library
library(nflverse)

# Function to download player statistics and filter for MVP-like performance metrics
get_top_players <- function(season) {
  # Load player stats for the given season
  player_stats <- load_player_stats(seasons = season)
  
  # Example: Filter for top QBs based on passing yards (adjust as needed for MVP criteria)
  top_players <- player_stats %>%
    dplyr::filter(position == "QB") %>%
    dplyr::arrange(desc(passing_yards)) %>%
    dplyr::select(player_name, team, passing_yards, season)
  
  return(top_players)
}

# Get top players for a single season (e.g., 2023)
top_players_2023 <- get_top_players(2023)
print(top_players_2023)

# Get top players for multiple seasons
seasons <- 2010:2023
top_players_by_year <- purrr::map_dfr(seasons, get_top_players)

# View the combined dataset
head(top_players_by_year)
External Sources for MVP Data
If you want official MVP rankings, you can scrape or download data from reliable external sources such as:

Pro Football Reference (https://www.pro-football-reference.com/)
Wikipedia pages for NFL MVP awards
NFL's official website or data API (if available)
Example Code for Web Scraping MVP Data
Here’s an example of scraping MVP data using the rvest package:

R
Copy code
library(rvest)
library(dplyr)

# URL for Wikipedia page with MVP data (adjust the URL as needed)
url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_Most_Valuable_Player_Award"

# Scrape the data table
mvp_data <- url %>%
  read_html() %>%
  html_table(fill = TRUE)

# Extract the relevant table and clean it
mvp_data_clean <- mvp_data[[1]] %>%  # Adjust the index based on the table structure
  select(Year, Player, Team) %>%
  mutate(Year = as.numeric(Year))

print(head(mvp_data_clean))
Combining MVP Data with Player Stats
You could merge external MVP data with NFL player statistics to analyze trends or deeper performance insights.

how would i get player season averages
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To calculate player season averages using the data from the nflverse package, you can process the data after loading it. Here's how you can do it step-by-step:

Code to Calculate Player Season Averages
R
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(nflverse)
library(dplyr)

# Download player statistics for all available seasons
available_seasons <- nflreadr::most_recent_season(return_type = "vector")
player_stats <- load_player_stats(seasons = 1999:available_seasons)

# Calculate season averages for each player
player_season_averages <- player_stats %>%
  group_by(player_id, player_name, season) %>% # Group by player and season
  summarise(
    avg_passing_yards = mean(passing_yards, na.rm = TRUE),  # Example stat: passing yards
    avg_rushing_yards = mean(rushing_yards, na.rm = TRUE),  # Example stat: rushing yards
    avg_receiving_yards = mean(receiving_yards, na.rm = TRUE),  # Example stat: receiving yards
    games_played = n(),  # Count of games played
    .groups = "drop"
  )

# View the first few rows
head(player_season_averages)

# Save the results to a file (optional)
write.csv(player_season_averages, "player_season_averages.csv", row.names = FALSE)
Explanation of the Code
group_by(player_id, player_name, season):

Groups data by player ID, name, and season to calculate averages for each season individually.
summarise():

Calculates averages for relevant statistics (e.g., passing_yards, rushing_yards, receiving_yards) using mean().
Includes a count of games played in the season with n().
na.rm = TRUE:

Ensures that missing values (NA) are ignored during calculation.
Customizing Statistics
You can calculate averages for other statistics by adding them to the summarise() function. For example:

Touchdowns: avg_touchdowns = mean(touchdowns, na.rm = TRUE)
Completions: avg_completions = mean(completions, na.rm = TRUE)
Output
The resulting player_season_averages dataset will look like this:

player_id	player_name	season	avg_passing_yards	avg_rushing_yards	avg_receiving_yards	games_played
12345	Patrick Mahomes	2023	285.3	25.7	0.0	17
67890	Derrick Henry	2023	0.0	104.5	15.2	17
Let me know if you need help with filtering specific positions, teams, or further aggregations!

is there a database with season stats for each player
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, the nflverse package provides season-level statistics for each player using the load_player_stats() function. This database aggregates player statistics by season, offering a comprehensive view of each player's performance in a given year.

How to Access Season Stats for Each Player
The load_player_stats() function retrieves season-level stats directly. Here's how you can load and inspect the data:

Example Code
R
Copy code
# Load the nflverse library
library(nflverse)

# Load player season-level stats for all available seasons
player_season_stats <- load_player_stats(seasons = 1999:2023)

# View the first few rows of the dataset
head(player_season_stats)

# Check the structure of the dataset
str(player_season_stats)
Key Columns in player_season_stats
The dataset includes many statistics for each player by season. Some of the most relevant columns are:

Player Info:

player_id: Unique player ID
player_name: Player's full name
position: Player's position (e.g., QB, RB, WR)
team: Team abbreviation
Season Info:

season: Year of the season
Performance Metrics:

passing_yards, passing_touchdowns, interceptions
rushing_yards, rushing_touchdowns
receiving_yards, receiving_touchdowns, receptions

how do I remove a line linter from all lines in a file
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If you want to remove a specific linter or comment (e.g., # noqa or # pylint: disable=<rule>), from all lines in a file, you can do so programmatically. Here's an example in Python to automate this process:

Python Script to Remove Linters
python
Copy code
# Define the path to your file
file_path = "your_file.py"

# Define the linter comment pattern to remove (e.g., "# noqa" or "# pylint: disable=")
linter_pattern = "# noqa"  # Replace with your specific pattern

# Read the file and remove the linter pattern
with open(file_path, "r") as file:
    lines = file.readlines()

# Remove the linter pattern from each line
cleaned_lines = [line.split(linter_pattern)[0].rstrip() + "\n" if linter_pattern in line else line for line in lines]

# Write the cleaned lines back to the file
with open(file_path, "w") as file:
    file.writelines(cleaned_lines)

print(f"Removed '{linter_pattern}' from all lines in {file_path}.")
Explanation
File Read: The script reads all lines of the file into a list.
Linter Removal:
Checks each line for the presence of the linter_pattern.
Splits the line at the pattern and keeps the part before it.
Write Back: The cleaned lines are written back to the original file.
Example
Input File (your_file.py):
python
Copy code
def example_function():  # noqa
    pass  # noqa
Output File (your_file.py):
python
Copy code
def example_function():
    pass
For Bulk Files
If you need to remove linters from multiple files in a directory:

python
Copy code
import os

# Directory containing your files
directory = "your_directory_path"
linter_pattern = "# noqa"  # Replace with your specific pattern

# Iterate over all Python files in the directory
for filename in os.listdir(directory):
    if filename.endswith(".py"):
        file_path = os.path.join(directory, filename)
        with open(file_path, "r") as file:
            lines = file.readlines()
        
        # Remove the linter pattern
        cleaned_lines = [line.split(linter_pattern)[0].rstrip() + "\n" if linter_pattern in line else line for line in lines]

        # Write the cleaned lines back to the file
        with open(file_path, "w") as file:
            file.writelines(cleaned_lines)
        
        print(f"Cleaned linters from {file_path}.")
This script is scalable for batch processing. Let me know if you need further modifications or additional features!






You said:
write.parquet" getting this error in R file
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The error might be due to several possible reasons. Here's a checklist to help you diagnose and fix the issue when using write.parquet in R.

Steps to Resolve the Issue
Ensure Required Package is Installed

The write.parquet function is provided by the arrow or sparklyr packages in R.
Install the arrow package if not already installed:
R
Copy code
install.packages("arrow")
Load the Arrow Package

Ensure the arrow package is loaded in your script:
R
Copy code
library(arrow)
Check Your Data Format

The input data for write_parquet() must be a data.frame or tibble. Confirm the structure of your data:
R
Copy code
str(your_data)
If the data is not a data.frame, convert it before writing:
R
Copy code
your_data <- as.data.frame(your_data)
Correct Usage of write_parquet

Specify the path where you want to save the file, including the .parquet extension:
R
Copy code
write_parquet(your_data, "your_file.parquet")
Check for Write Permissions

Ensure the directory where you are saving the .parquet file has write permissions. You can check by attempting to write another file:
R
Copy code
write.csv(your_data, "test.csv")
Verify R and Arrow Versions

Older versions of R or the arrow package might lack some functionalities. Ensure you are using an up-to-date version of R and arrow. Check your arrow version:
R
Copy code
packageVersion("arrow")
Check for Conflicts with Other Packages

If multiple packages are loaded and there’s a function name conflict, ensure you are explicitly calling the arrow::write_parquet function:
R
Copy code
arrow::write_parquet(your_data, "your_file.parquet")
Inspect the Error Message

If you are still encountering errors, inspect the specific error message for clues:
R
Copy code
tryCatch(
  {
    write_parquet(your_data, "your_file.parquet")
  },
  error = function(e) {
    message("Error: ", e$message)
  }
)
Example Usage
Here’s a full example for context:

R
Copy code
# Install and load the arrow package
if (!requireNamespace("arrow", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("arrow")
}
library(arrow)

# Sample data
your_data <- data.frame(
  id = 1:5,
  value = c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
)

# Write to a Parquet file
write_parquet(your_data, "your_file.parquet")

# Verify the file exists
if (file.exists("your_file.parquet")) {
  print("File written successfully!")
}
If the issue persists, share the specific error message for a more detailed diagnosis.

# Directory to save Parquet files
output_dir <- "playbyplay_data"
if (!dir.exists(output_dir)) dir.create(output_dir)

# Loop through each season
for (year in start_year:end_year) {
  tryCatch({
    # Download play-by-play data for the year
    pbp_data <- load_pbp(year)
    
    # Define the output file name
    output_file <- file.path(output_dir, paste0("playbyplay_", year, ".parquet"))
    
    # Save the data as a Parquet file
    write_parquet(pbp_data, output_file)
    
    # Message indicating success
    message("Successfully saved play-by-play data for ", year, " to ", output_file)
  }, error = function(e) {
    # Handle any errors
    message("Error downloading or saving data for ", year, ": ", e$message)
  })
}
Explanation of the Code
Seasons Range:

start_year and end_year define the range of seasons to download.
Output Directory:

Creates a directory playbyplay_data to store the Parquet files if it doesn't already exist.
for Loop:

Iterates through each year, downloading play-by-play data using load_pbp().

To download the season win-loss record for each NFL team for every season, you can use the nflverse package. The load_team_stats() or load_schedules() function can provide the necessary information.

Here’s how to do it:

1. Using load_team_stats()
The load_team_stats() function includes team performance data for each season, including wins and losses.

Example Code:
R
Copy code
# Load necessary library
library(nflverse)

# Load team stats for all available seasons
team_stats <- load_team_stats(seasons = 1999:2023)

# Select columns relevant to win-loss records
win_loss_data <- team_stats %>%
  select(team, season, wins, losses, ties) %>%
  arrange(season, team)

# View the first few rows
head(win_loss_data)

head(win_loss_data)

# Save to a CSV file (optional)
write.csv(win_loss_data, "team_win_loss_record_from_schedules.csv", row.names = FALSE)
Explanation of Code:
Using load_team_stats():

Directly provides aggregated win-loss data per season for each team.
Requires no additional calculations.
Using load_schedules():

Processes individual game results to calculate win-loss records.
Separates wins and losses for home and away games, then aggregates them.
Output Example:
team	season	wins	losses	ties
BUF	2023	11	6	0
KC	2023	13	4	0
NE	2023	8	9	0

Here’s the R code to calculate the season win-loss record for each team using the load_schedules() function from the nflverse package:

Code to Calculate Win-Loss Records from Schedule Data
R
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(nflverse)
library(dplyr)

# Load schedules for all available seasons
schedules <- load_schedules(seasons = 1999:2023)

# Calculate win-loss records
win_loss_data <- schedules %>%
  # Add win/loss/tie flags for home and away teams
  mutate(
    home_win = ifelse(home_score > away_score, 1, 0),
    home_loss = ifelse(home_score < away_score, 1, 0),
    away_win = ifelse(away_score > home_score, 1, 0),
    away_loss = ifelse(away_score < home_score, 1, 0),
    tie = ifelse(home_score == away_score, 1, 0)
  ) %>%
  # Aggregate wins, losses, and ties for home and away teams
  summarise(
    home_records = group_by(season, home_team) %>%
      summarise(
        wins = sum(home_win),
        losses = sum(home_loss),
        ties = sum(tie),

# Save the data to a CSV file (optional)
write.csv(final_win_loss, "season_win_loss_records.csv", row.names = FALSE)
Explanation:
Mutate Flags:

Calculate whether a team won, lost, or tied for both home and away teams.
Aggregate Home and Away Records:

Group data by season and team (home_team and away_team) to calculate wins, losses, and ties separately for home and away games.
Combine Results:

Combine the home and away records into a single dataset using bind_rows() and aggregate totals for each team by season.
Save Data:

Optionally save the resulting data to a CSV file for further use.
Output Example:
season	team	total_wins	total_losses	total_ties
2023	BUF	11	6	0
2023	KC	14	3	0
2023	NE	7	10	0

can i source this from nflverse
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The nflverse package in R is a comprehensive resource for accessing a wide array of NFL data, including play-by-play details, player statistics, and team information. However, it does not provide real-time or current-season playoff odds or probabilities. These odds are typically generated by sportsbooks or specialized analytics platforms that assess team performance, remaining schedules, and other factors to estimate playoff chances.

For the most up-to-date playoff odds, you might consider consulting reputable sports analytics websites or sportsbooks. These platforms offer real-time data and projections that can complement the historical and statistical data available through nflverse.

If you're interested in analyzing historical playoff data or team performance trends, nflverse can be a valuable tool. By leveraging its datasets, you can perform in-depth analyses to understand factors that have influenced playoff outcomes in past seasons.

In summary, while nflverse is excellent for accessing extensive NFL data, it does not provide current-season playoff odds. For real-time playoff probabilities, consider using specialized sports analytics platforms or sportsbooks.

how do I add column names to this dfplayoff_probs = pd.DataFrame(playoff_proba)
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To add column names to your DataFrame playoff_probs, you can use the columns attribute in pandas. Here's how you can do it:

Example Code:
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Existing DataFrame
playoff_proba = [
    ["NYJ", 0.02], ["LA", 0.10], ["ATL", 0.51], ["SEA", 0.46], ["NO", 0.04],
    ["DAL", 0.03], ["DET", 1.00], ["CLE", 0.00], ["KC", 1.00], ["BAL", 0.99],
    ["TB", 0.54], ["BUF", 1.00], ["MIN", 0.98], ["ARI", 0.51], ["LV", 0.00],
    ["NYG", 0.00], ["MIA", 0.16], ["GB", 0.91], ["LAC", 0.86], ["PHI", 1.0],
    ["CIN", 0.13], ["PIT", 0.93], ["JAX", 0.00], ["SF", 0.15], ["HOU", 0.94],
    ["DEN", 0.73], ["NE", 0.00], ["WAS", 0.59], ["CHI", 0.00]
]

# Create the DataFrame
playoff_probs = pd.DataFrame(playoff_proba)

# Add column names
playoff_probs.columns = ["Team", "Probability"]

# Display the DataFrame
print(playoff_probs)
Output:
Team	Probability
NYJ	0.02
LA	0.10
ATL	0.51
SEA	0.46
NO	0.04
...	...
Explanation:
Create the DataFrame:

The playoff_proba list is converted into a DataFrame using pd.DataFrame().
Set Column Names:

Use playoff_probs.columns to set column names explicitly as ["Team", "Probability"].
This assigns meaningful names to the columns for easier analysis and readability.


fix this code so df contains rows where names in the group:
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_parquet('data/results_data/mvp_2024_stats_with_results.parquet')


columns = ['win_pct', 'td:int', 'passing_tds', 'rushing_tds', 'passing_yards', 'rushing_yards',
           'passing_first_downs','rushing_first_downs', 'pacr', 'total_fumble_lost', 'sacks', 'sack_yards'
           'interceptions', 'gp']

df= df[df['player_display_name'] in ["Josh Allen", "Lamar Jackson", "Jalen Hurts", "Jared Goff", "Patrick Mahomes", "Joe Burrow", "Jayden Daniels"]]
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
It seems like there are a couple of issues in the code:

You forgot to add a comma between 'sack_yards' and 'interceptions' in the list of columns.
The condition df['player_display_name'] in ["Josh Allen", ...] is incorrect because it should be applied element-wise to the DataFrame.
The columns you've specified aren't being used for anything. If you want to limit the DataFrame to only those columns, you need to explicitly reference them.
Here is the corrected code:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_parquet('data/results_data/mvp_2024_stats_with_results.parquet')

columns = ['win_pct', 'td:int', 'passing_tds', 'rushing_tds', 'passing_yards', 'rushing_yards',
           'passing_first_downs', 'rushing_first_downs', 'pacr', 'total_fumble_lost', 'sacks', 'sack_yards',
           'interceptions', 'gp']

# Filter the rows where 'player_display_name' is in the specified list
df = df[df['player_display_name'].isin(["Josh Allen", "Lamar Jackson", "Jalen Hurts", "Jared Goff", "Patrick Mahomes", "Joe Burrow", "Jayden Daniels"])]

# Select only the specified columns
df = df[columns]
Explanation of the changes:

Added a comma between 'sack_yards' and 'interceptions' in the columns list.
Replaced df['player_display_name'] in [...] with df['player_display_name'].isin([...]) to correctly filter rows.
Added a line to select only the columns specified in the columns list.




You said:
before restricting to those player names edit the code so For columns in columns i get a rank for those columns. E.g if passing yards is highest of players in teh dataset, rank = 1 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To rank the players based on the specified columns, you can use the rank() function from pandas. Here's how you can modify the code to add a ranking for each specified column:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Read the DataFrame from the parquet file
df = pd.read_parquet('data/results_data/mvp_2024_stats_with_results.parquet')

# List of columns to rank
columns = ['win_pct', 'td:int', 'passing_tds', 'rushing_tds', 'passing_yards', 'rushing_yards',
           'passing_first_downs', 'rushing_first_downs', 'pacr', 'total_fumble_lost', 'sacks', 'sack_yards',
           'interceptions', 'gp']

# Add rank columns for each of the specified columns
for col in columns:
    # Create a new column with ranking for each metric
    df[f'rank_{col}'] = df[col].rank(ascending=False, method='min')

# Filter the rows where 'player_display_name' is in the specified list
df = df[df['player_display_name'].isin(["Josh Allen", "Lamar Jackson", "Jalen Hurts", "Jared Goff", "Patrick Mahomes", "Joe Burrow", "Jayden Daniels"])]

# Select only the specified columns and their corresponding rank columns
rank_columns = [f'rank_{col}' for col in columns]
df = df[columns + rank_columns]
Explanation of the changes:

Ranking Columns:
I added a loop over the columns list.
For each column in columns, I added a new column with the prefix rank_ to indicate the rank of each player for that specific column. The rank is calculated using df[col].rank(ascending=False, method='min'), where:
ascending=False ranks in descending order (highest values get rank 1).
method='min' assigns the minimum rank to ties.
Filtering Players:
The filter for player_display_name remains the same using .isin().
Selecting Specific Columns:
The final DataFrame includes the original columns as well as the new ranking columns. The list of rank columns is created using list comprehension: rank_columns = [f'rank_{col}' for col in columns].
This will add ranking columns based on the values of each metric, where higher values receive a better rank (1 being the highest).

It seems like the environment is missing the necessary library to read Parquet files (pyarrow or fastparquet). If you are able to install these libraries, you could resolve this issue.

To proceed, you can install the required library by running one of the following commands:

sh
Copy code
pip install pyarrow
or

sh
Copy code
pip install fastparquet
Once installed, try running the code again to generate the desired table. Let me know if you need any other assistance in the meantime! ​​

It appears that the pyarrow or fastparquet library is still missing, which is preventing the Parquet file from being read. If possible, please install one of these libraries using:

sh
Copy code
pip install pyarrow
or

sh
Copy code
pip install fastparquet
Once you have installed either pyarrow or fastparquet, the code will be able to execute and generate the table you need for your paper. Let me know if you need further assistance or would like an alternative approach. ​​

ive added this now show me the code to create the table i desire
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
It seems that the environment is still unable to access the pyarrow or fastparquet library for reading the Parquet file. Unfortunately, without installing one of these libraries, I won't be able to load the data directly.

If you have installed pyarrow or fastparquet, you should ensure that it is properly installed in the environment that you are using to run the code. If there are any issues during installation, please let me know and I'll help troubleshoot.

Alternatively, if you can convert the Parquet file to a CSV file, I can help modify the code to work with that format. Let me know how you'd like to proceed. ​​

you misunderstand my problem the dataset includes many values is there  a package that exists to generate a clean looking tbale of the columns i desire and include the rank in this table. rows are player_names, columns are teh stats Ive created ranks for
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To generate a clean and professional-looking table for your dataset, including the ranks for each statistic alongside the values, you can use the tabulate or pandas package for simpler tables. However, for generating a more formatted, paper-ready output, you could consider using:

1. pandas with Styler
pandas itself has some built-in capabilities for creating tables with additional formatting, especially if you use pandas Styler. It allows you to create a clean-looking table with values and ranks.

2. prettytable
prettytable is useful for creating ASCII formatted tables. It's lightweight and can display the rows in a concise way.

3. matplotlib with table
For tables that need to be embedded in papers or presentations, the matplotlib package has a table functionality that allows you to plot a table as part of a figure.

4. plotly
If you want interactive tables that are well-formatted, plotly's create_table() function can be very effective.

5. latex Output
If you need to include this table in a LaTeX document, you could use pandas to output in a LaTeX-friendly format.

I'll provide an example using pandas and plotly to create a table that displays the stats along with their ranks.

Example Using Pandas Styler
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_parquet('data/results_data/mvp_2024_stats_with_results.parquet')

# Define columns for ranking high and low values
high_columns = ['win_pct', 'td:int', 'passing_tds', 'rushing_tds', 'passing_yards', 'rushing_yards',
                'passing_first_downs', 'rushing_first_downs', 'pacr', 'gp']
low_columns = ['total_fumble_lost', 'sacks', 'sack_yards', 'interceptions']

# Rank the columns accordingly
for col in high_columns:
    df[f'rank_{col}'] = df[col].rank(ascending=False, method='min')
for col in low_columns:
    df[f'rank_{col}'] = df[col].rank(ascending=True, method='min')

# Filter rows for specific players
df_filtered = df[df['player_display_name'].isin(["Josh Allen", "Lamar Jackson", "Jalen Hurts", "Jared Goff", "Patrick Mahomes", "Joe Burrow", "Jayden Daniels"])]

# Prepare a DataFrame with values and their respective ranks in brackets
columns = high_columns + low_columns
rank_columns = [f'rank_{col}' for col in columns]

# Create a new DataFrame with values and their respective ranks in brackets
df_display = df_filtered[['player_display_name'] + columns + rank_columns].copy()

for col, rank_col in zip(columns, rank_columns):
    df_display[col] = df_display[col].astype(str) + " (" + df_display[rank_col].astype(int).astype(str) + ")"

# Drop the rank columns, keeping only the formatted columns
df_display = df_display[['player_display_name'] + columns]

# Use Pandas Styler to generate a nice-looking table
styled_table = df_display.style.set_table_styles(
    [{'selector': 'thead th', 'props': [('background-color', '#f0f0f0'), ('font-weight', 'bold')]}]
).set_caption("Player Stats with Values and Rankings")

# Display the styled table
styled_table
Example Using Plotly to Create a Clean Table
python
Copy code
import plotly.graph_objects as go

# Prepare the data for the table
header = ['Player'] + columns
table_data = [df_display['player_display_name'].tolist()] + [df_display[col].tolist() for col in columns]

# Create the table using Plotly
fig = go.Figure(data=[go.Table(
    header=dict(values=header,
                fill_color='paleturquoise',
                align='left'),
    cells=dict(values=table_data,
               fill_color='lavender',
               align='left'))
])

# Show the figure
fig.show()
Summary:
pandas Styler can give you a simple and easy-to-customize output for quick documentation purposes.
plotly is great if you want a clean, visual representation of your data that's more interactive.
Feel free to choose the approach that suits your needs for presentation, and let me know if you need further customization for your paper!





You said:
is there a way to display the rank value in the same column as the value 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, you can absolutely display both the value and its corresponding rank in the same column in the DataFrame. This can be accomplished by concatenating the original value with the rank in a formatted string, which will make your table cleaner and more compact for presentation.

Below, I'll demonstrate how you can achieve this with pandas to create a DataFrame where each player's stats include the rank in parentheses right next to the value:

Example Code Using Pandas to Combine Value and Rank in One Column:
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_parquet('data/results_data/mvp_2024_stats_with_results.parquet')

# Define columns for ranking high and low values
high_columns = ['win_pct', 'td:int', 'passing_tds', 'rushing_tds', 'passing_yards', 'rushing_yards',
                'passing_first_downs', 'rushing_first_downs', 'pacr', 'gp']
low_columns = ['total_fumble_lost', 'sacks', 'sack_yards', 'interceptions']

# Rank the columns accordingly
for col in high_columns:
    df[f'rank_{col}'] = df[col].rank(ascending=False, method='min')
for col in low_columns:
    df[f'rank_{col}'] = df[col].rank(ascending=True, method='min')

# Filter rows for specific players
df_filtered = df[df['player_display_name'].isin(["Josh Allen", "Lamar Jackson", "Jalen Hurts", "Jared Goff", "Patrick Mahomes", "Joe Burrow", "Jayden Daniels"])]

# Prepare a DataFrame with values and their respective ranks in brackets
columns = high_columns + low_columns
rank_columns = [f'rank_{col}' for col in columns]

# Create a new DataFrame where each value includes its rank
df_display = df_filtered[['player_display_name']].copy()

for col, rank_col in zip(columns, rank_columns):
    df_display[col] = df_filtered.apply(lambda row: f"{row[col]} ({int(row[rank_col])})", axis=1)

# Display the DataFrame
import ace_tools as tools; tools.display_dataframe_to_user(name="Player Stats with Values and Rankings Combined", dataframe=df_display)
Explanation:
Ranking:

For each column in high_columns, ranks are calculated in descending order (ascending=False) so that the highest values receive rank 1.
For low_columns, ranks are calculated in ascending order (ascending=True) so that the lowest values receive rank 1.
Filtering Players:

The DataFrame is filtered to include only the desired players.
Combining Values and Ranks:

A new DataFrame (df_display) is created with only the player names initially.
The loop iterates over each column in columns and rank_columns. For each player, the value and the rank are combined using a formatted string: "value (rank)".
This approach ensures that each value in the column is followed by its rank in parentheses.
Displaying the Table:

The final DataFrame (df_display) is shown to the user, where each player’s stats are displayed in the format: value (rank).
This approach will help in making the table more concise and easier to interpret, especially for presentation in a paper. Let me know if you need further adjustments or enhancements to this table!

why wont ace_tools install
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The ace_tools module is a utility that I can use within this environment for specific display purposes, but it's not available externally for installation. In this environment, it helps present dataframes to you in a more readable form, but when you run the code on your local machine, you won’t need it, nor will you be able to install it.

Instead, for local use, you could use:

Standard Pandas Display: You can simply use the .head() method or directly display the DataFrame for basic viewing:

python
Copy code
print(df_display)
Jupyter Notebooks: If you are working in a Jupyter Notebook, the pandas DataFrame will automatically render beautifully:

python
Copy code
df_display
Styler for Better Presentation: For a more formatted version, you can use the pandas Styler:

python
Copy code
df_display.style.set_caption("Player Stats with Values and Rankings Combined")
Export to CSV or Excel: If you want to share the data or use it in a paper, exporting it to CSV or Excel might be the best approach:

python
Copy code
df_display.to_csv('player_stats_with_rankings.csv', index=False)
or

python
Copy code
df_display.to_excel('player_stats_with_rankings.xlsx', index=False)
Let me know if you need help with any of these alternatives for displaying or exporting your table!

To display the rankings below the values for better readability, you can modify the lambda function so that the rank appears on a new line. You can also rename the columns to make them cleaner and more descriptive. Here's how to do that:

Steps to Improve Readability:
Multi-line Representation: Use line breaks (\n) in the lambda function to make the rank appear on a new line.
Rename Columns: Rename the columns to have more descriptive names for better readability.
Use Pandas Styling: In Jupyter Notebooks, you can use pandas Styler to display it nicely. If you're working in a terminal, just printing the DataFrame should also work, but the multi-line display might need special formatting.
Here's the updated code:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_parquet('data/results_data/mvp_2024_stats_with_results.parquet')

# Define columns for ranking high and low values
high_columns = ['win_pct', 'td:int', 'passing_tds', 'rushing_tds', 'passing_yards', 'rushing_yards',
                'passing_first_downs', 'rushing_first_downs', 'pacr', 'gp']
low_columns = ['total_fumbles_lost', 'sacks', 'sack_yards', 'interceptions']

# Round specific columns for easier presentation
df[['win_pct', 'td:int', 'pacr']] = df[['win_pct', 'td:int', 'pacr']].round(3)
df[['passing_yards', 'rushing_yards', 'sack_yards']] = df[['passing_yards', 'rushing_yards', 'sack_yards']].round(1)
df[['passing_tds', 'rushing_tds', 'interceptions', 'sacks', 'passing_first_downs', 'rushing_first_downs', 'gp', 'total_fumbles_lost']] = df[['passing_tds', 'rushing_tds', 'interceptions', 'sacks', 'passing_first_downs', 'rushing_first_downs', 'gp', 'total_fumbles_lost']].round(0)

# Rank the columns accordingly
for col in high_columns:
    df[f'rank_{col}'] = df[col].rank(ascending=False, method='min')
for col in low_columns:
    df[f'rank_{col}'] = df[col].rank(ascending=True, method='min')

# Filter rows for specific players
df_filtered = df[df['player_display_name'].isin(["Josh Allen", "Lamar Jackson", "Jalen Hurts", "Jared Goff", "Patrick Mahomes", "Joe Burrow", "Jayden Daniels"])]

# Prepare a DataFrame with values and their respective ranks on a new line
columns = high_columns + low_columns
rank_columns = [f'rank_{col}' for col in columns]

df_display = df_filtered[['player_display_name']].copy()

for col, rank_col in zip(columns, rank_columns):
    # Format value and rank to show rank on a new line
    df_display[col] = df_filtered.apply(lambda row: f"{row[col]}\n(Rank: {int(row[rank_col])})", axis=1)

# Rename columns to be more descriptive
df_display.rename(columns={
    'player_display_name': 'Player Name',
    'win_pct': 'Win Percentage',
    'td:int': 'Total Touchdowns',
    'passing_tds': 'Passing Touchdowns',
    'rushing_tds': 'Rushing Touchdowns',
    'passing_yards': 'Passing Yards',
    'rushing_yards': 'Rushing Yards',
    'passing_first_downs': 'Passing First Downs',
    'rushing_first_downs': 'Rushing First Downs',
    'pacr': 'PACR',
    'gp': 'Games Played',
    'total_fumbles_lost': 'Total Fumbles Lost',
    'sacks': 'Sacks',
    'sack_yards': 'Sack Yards',
    'interceptions': 'Interceptions'
}, inplace=True)

# Display the DataFrame in a cleaner format
import ace_tools as tools; tools.display_dataframe_to_user(name="Player Stats with Values and Rankings Below", dataframe=df_display)
Changes Made:
Multi-line Representation:

Updated the lambda function to format each value and rank with a line break (\n). This means the rank is displayed on a new line right below the value for better readability.
Example format: "value\n(Rank: rank)"
Column Renaming:

Used df_display.rename() to rename the columns to more descriptive names, which makes the table more understandable.
Display Using ace_tools:

I used ace_tools to display the DataFrame in a readable way in this environment.
If you are using Jupyter Notebook, simply display df_display or use .style for better formatting.
Alternate Viewing Options:
If you are in Jupyter Notebook, you can use the following to get a styled table:

python
Copy code
df_display.style.set_caption("Player Stats with Values and Rankings").set_table_styles(
    [{'selector': 'thead th', 'props': [('font-weight', 'bold')]}]
)
If running in a script:

python
Copy code
print(df_display)
This should give you a clean, formatted table where each value is followed by its rank on the next line, making it more suitable for use in a paper or presentation.

The ace_tools module is specific to my environment and is used for displaying dataframes directly to you here. Since you're running this on your local machine or another environment, you'll need to use different approaches to display or visualize the DataFrame effectively.

Here are some alternatives to ace_tools:

1. Displaying the DataFrame in Jupyter Notebook
If you're working in a Jupyter Notebook, you can simply display the DataFrame with this code:

python
Copy code
df_display
This will render the DataFrame with proper formatting.

2. Print the DataFrame in Terminal or Script
If you're running the code in a Python script or terminal, use the print() function:

python
Copy code
print(df_display)
This will display the DataFrame, although it might not look as neat as in a notebook.

3. Using pandas Styler for Enhanced Formatting in Jupyter
If you want a more visually appealing output in a Jupyter Notebook, you can use pandas Styler:

python
Copy code
styled_table = df_display.style.set_caption("Top Player Stats with Values and Rankings").set_table_styles(
    [{'selector': 'thead th', 'props': [('font-weight', 'bold'), ('background-color', '#f0f0f0')]}]
).set_properties(**{'white-space': 'pre-wrap'})

styled_table
This approach adds a caption, bolds the header, and makes sure the ranking text wraps appropriately to keep the formatting clean.

4. Export to CSV or Excel
For creating a table you can use in your paper or presentation, exporting to CSV or Excel might be useful:

python
Copy code
df_display.to_csv('top_player_stats_with_rankings.csv', index=False)
or

python
Copy code
df_display.to_excel('top_player_stats_with_rankings.xlsx', index=False)
These files can then be imported into tools like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, where you can further format them as needed.

Let me know if you need help with one of these methods or more formatting suggestions!

There's an incomplete code section data[[]] in your script. It looks like you might have intended to subset or manipulate the MVP data, but this was left unfinished.
You could replace it with an actual operation to continue your analysis, such as filtering or transforming the mvp_df.
Concatenating QB Stats (for year in ["00s", "10s", "20s"]):

You correctly try to read parquet files from different years and append them to a list named stats. If files are missing, you're handling that gracefully.
The stats DataFrame is being filtered for QBs (stats[stats['position'] == 'QB']). You may want to ensure that the column names align between different parquet files to avoid unexpected errors.
Aggregating Stats:

The aggregation dictionary aggregate_columns seems comprehensive, but there are a couple of improvements to consider:
Consistency Check: Make sure all the columns listed in aggregate_columns are present in the stats DataFrame. If not, you may want to add a validation step before performing the aggregation.
Handling Missing Columns: To avoid issues if some columns are missing, you could use:
python
Copy code
available_columns = set(stats.columns)
valid_aggregations = {k: v for k, v in aggregate_columns.items() if k in available_columns}
Saving Data:

After aggregating, you're saving the resulting DataFrame in CSV and parquet formats, which is great for flexibility.
It's a good idea to verify that the saved files contain all the intended information by including a quick preview with season_stats.head() before saving.
Here’s a cleaned-up version with improvements:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import pyarrow

# MVP RANKING
# MVP data gathered from https://www.pro-football-reference.com/awards/ap-nfl-mvp-award.htm
data = [
    [2023, 'NFL', 'QB', 'Lamar Jackson', 'Baltimore Ravens'],
    [2022, 'NFL', 'QB', 'Patrick Mahomes', 'Kansas City Chiefs'],
    # ... other data omitted for brevity ...
    [2000, 'NFL', 'RB', 'Marshall Faulk', 'St. Louis Rams']
]
columns = ['season', 'league', 'position', 'player', 'team']
mvp_df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=columns)
print(mvp_df.head())

# SEASON STATS
# Gathering season stats for each player in each year (that is a QB)
qb_df = mvp_df[mvp_df['position'] == "QB"]

# Load raw season stats data
stats = []
for year in ["00s", "10s", "20s"]:
    file_path = f"data/raw_data/game_stats/player_game_{year}.parquet"
    try:
        df = pd.read_parquet(file_path)
        stats.append(df)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        # Skip years where the file does not exist
        continue

if stats:  # Check if any data was loaded
    stats = pd.concat(stats, ignore_index=True)
    stats = stats[stats['position'] == 'QB']

    # Aggregation columns
    available_columns = set(stats.columns)
    valid_aggregations = {k: v for k, v in aggregate_columns.items() if k in available_columns}

    # Group by player_id, player_name, season and aggregate
    season_stats = stats.groupby(['player_id', 'player_name', 'season']).agg(valid_aggregations).reset_index()

    # Preview before saving
    print(season_stats.head())

    # Save cleaned data
    season_stats.to_csv("data/cleaned_data/qb_season_stats.csv", index=False)
    season_stats.to_parquet("data/cleaned_data/qb_season_stats.parquet", index=False)

else:
    print("No game stats were loaded for any year.")
Key Changes Made:
Filtered valid_aggregations to only include columns that exist in the DataFrame, avoiding key errors.
Preview Data Before Saving (print(season_stats.head())) to ensure that your aggregation produced the expected result.
Added if stats: condition to check if any files were successfully read before attempting the concatenation and aggregation.
These changes should make your script more robust and handle missing files or columns more gracefully. Let me know if you need further help refining the code or adding new features!

To filter the season_stats DataFrame so that it only includes data for the years and player names that match the mvp_df DataFrame, you can perform an inner merge operation after calculating the seasonal statistics. Here is an updated version of your code with the filtering added:

Mvp Qb Season Filter
I have added the necessary code to filter season_stats such that only data where both the year and player name match the mvp_df DataFrame is retained. This ensures that the resulting dataset focuses specifically on the quarterbacks who won the MVP in their respective seasons.

To improve your model's robustness, I recommend splitting your dataset into training and testing sets using stratified sampling or other methods that account for variability within your dataset. Here are a few approaches to consider:

Stratified Sampling: If your data has imbalanced categories (e.g., MVP winners vs. others), you may use stratified sampling to ensure that both training and test sets are representative. For example:

python
Copy code
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Create the X and y datasets
x = mvp_season_stats[vars]
y = mvp_season_stats['votes']

# Stratified Split to maintain the ratio of target classes (useful if votes are imbalanced)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=25, stratify=y)
Time-based Splitting: Since your data is related to player seasons, it may make sense to use a temporal split for training and testing. For example, you can train on older data and test on newer seasons to simulate a real-world scenario. Here’s how:

python
Copy code
# Sort by season to split chronologically
mvp_season_stats = mvp_season_stats.sort_values('season')

# Use a 80-20 split for training on earlier seasons and testing on later seasons
split_index = int(len(mvp_season_stats) * 0.8)
X_train = mvp_season_stats[vars][:split_index]
y_train = mvp_season_stats['votes'][:split_index]
X_test = mvp_season_stats[vars][split_index:]
y_test = mvp_season_stats['votes'][split_index:]
Random Split with Multiple Seeds: To avoid dependency on a single random split, you can repeat the split with different seeds to generate multiple models and average their results. For example:

python
Copy code
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import numpy as np

mse_scores = []
r2_scores = []

for seed in range(5):  # Run 5 different seeds
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=seed)
    
    # Train the model
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate the model
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
    r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

    mse_scores.append(mse)
    r2_scores.append(r2)

# Average performance
avg_mse = np.mean(mse_scores)
avg_r2 = np.mean(r2_scores)

print(f"Average Mean Squared Error: {avg_mse}")
print(f"Average R-squared: {avg_r2}")
These strategies can help ensure that your model is not biased by the way the data is split, and can potentially improve the model's generalizability. Let me know which approach makes the most sense for your use case, or if you need more help implementing them.

how m how to set all years <2010 to be training years

2/2

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To set all years less than 2010 as training years and all years greater or equal to 2010 as testing years, you can simply filter your dataset based on the season column. Here's how to implement this approach:

python
Copy code
# Filter the training and testing data based on the 'season' column
train_data = mvp_season_stats[mvp_season_stats['season'] < 2010]
test_data = mvp_season_stats[mvp_season_stats['season'] >= 2010]

# Create the training and testing feature sets (X) and target sets (y)
X_train = train_data[vars]
y_train = train_data['votes']
X_test = test_data[vars]
y_test = test_data['votes']

# Initialize the linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
print(f"R-squared: {r2}")

# Display the coefficients
coef_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Feature': vars,
    'Coefficient': model.coef_
})

print(coef_df)
Explanation:
Filtering Data:

train_data = mvp_season_stats[mvp_season_stats['season'] < 2010] creates a DataFrame with only records before the year 2010.
test_data = mvp_season_stats[mvp_season_stats['season'] >= 2010] creates a DataFrame with records from 2010 and beyond.
Splitting Features and Target:

X_train and X_test contain the independent variables (vars) for training and testing.
y_train and y_test contain the target variable (votes) for training and testing.
Model Training and Evaluation:

The training and testing datasets are then used to train and evaluate the model.
This approach will ensure that your training data only includes seasons before 2010, and the model will be tested on data from 2010 and onward, which is often a good practice in time series or chronological data to avoid data leakage.

how to do deneral linar rgrssion
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To perform general linear regression (often referred to as multiple linear regression) in Python, you can use popular libraries like scikit-learn, statsmodels, or others. Below, I'll guide you through using both scikit-learn and statsmodels.

1. Using scikit-learn
The scikit-learn approach is more straightforward and is often used for predictive modeling. Here's an example:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score

# Assuming 'mvp_season_stats' DataFrame is already defined and has relevant data
# Define independent variables and the dependent variable
vars = ['completion_pct_pg', 'passing_yards_pg', 'passing_tds_pg', 'interceptions_pg',
        'passing_air_yards_pg', 'passing_yards_after_catch_pg', 'sacks_pg', 
        'passing_first_downs_pg', 'passing_epa_pg', 'passing_2pt_conversions_pg',
        'rushing_yards_pg', 'rushing_tds_pg', 'rushing_first_downs_pg',
        'rushing_2pt_conversions_pg', 'total_wins', 'total_losses', 'total_ties']

X = mvp_season_stats[vars]
y = mvp_season_stats['votes']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=25)

# Initialize the linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
print(f"R-squared: {r2}")

# Display the coefficients
coef_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Feature': vars,
    'Coefficient': model.coef_
})
print(coef_df)
Explanation:

The LinearRegression class from sklearn.linear_model is used to create a linear regression model.
The .fit() method trains the model on the training set.
mean_squared_error() and r2_score() are used to evaluate the model's performance.
2. Using statsmodels
The statsmodels library is used when you need detailed statistical summaries of your regression results, such as p-values, confidence intervals, etc.

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Assuming 'mvp_season_stats' DataFrame is already defined and has relevant data
# Define independent variables and the dependent variable
vars = ['completion_pct_pg', 'passing_yards_pg', 'passing_tds_pg', 'interceptions_pg',
        'passing_air_yards_pg', 'passing_yards_after_catch_pg', 'sacks_pg', 
        'passing_first_downs_pg', 'passing_epa_pg', 'passing_2pt_conversions_pg',
        'rushing_yards_pg', 'rushing_tds_pg', 'rushing_first_downs_pg',
        'rushing_2pt_conversions_pg', 'total_wins', 'total_losses', 'total_ties']

X = mvp_season_stats[vars]
y = mvp_season_stats['votes']

# Add a constant term to the predictor variables (intercept)
X = sm.add_constant(X)

# Fit the model
model = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()

# Get the summary of the regression
print(model.summary())
Explanation:

sm.OLS() fits an ordinary least squares regression model.
Adding a constant with sm.add_constant(X) ensures an intercept term in the model.
.fit() method trains the model, and .summary() provides a detailed statistical output.
Comparison Between scikit-learn and statsmodels
scikit-learn is great for building and evaluating predictive models, especially if you are interested in model accuracy.
statsmodels provides more insight into the model, including statistics such as coefficients, standard errors, p-values, and confidence intervals, which help in understanding the relationships in the data.
Key Steps for General Linear Regression
Define Variables: Identify the dependent (y) and independent (X) variables.
Split Data: Divide the data into training and testing sets.
Fit the Model: Use .fit() method to train the model.
Evaluate: Use metrics like MSE, R-squared to evaluate performance.
Interpret Coefficients: Look at the coefficient values to understand how each variable affects the dependent variable.
Choose the approach that suits your requirements based on whether you are focusing more on prediction or statistical analysis. Let me know if you need more help on any of these steps!

4. Generate HTML for Direct Use in Word Processors
If you are using a word processor like Word or Google Docs, you can convert the DataFrame to an HTML table, which can be easily copied and pasted.

python
Copy code
# Export to HTML for use in word processors
html_table = max_stats.to_html(index=False)
print(html_table)
The HTML can be copied and pasted directly, and most word processors will retain the table structure.

5. Formatted Output with Pandas Styler
Using the Pandas Styler, you can apply custom styles to the table to create a polished HTML output, which can be embedded or included in documents.

python
Copy code
styled_table = max_stats.style.set_caption("Max Season Statistics per Year")\
    .highlight_max(axis=0, color='lightgreen')\
    .format(precision=2)

# Render the styled table as HTML
html_styled_table = styled_table.render()
print(html_styled_table)
This will allow you to highlight important values, adjust precision, and include a caption. You can then save or copy the generated HTML to use in your report.

Summary of Options
PrettyTable: For nice terminal output and basic copying.
LaTeX Export: If your paper is written in LaTeX.
CSV Export: To format using Excel or Word.
HTML Export: To copy directly into Google Docs or Word.

## Introduction
This report analyzes the MVP prediction model using data from multiple seasons. The following sections present the results of the XGBoost classifier used to predict MVP votes.

## Data Overview
```{python}
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_parquet("data/cleaned_data/mvp_season_stats_with_binary.parquet")
print("Columns in dataset:")
print(df.columns.to_list())

# Display basic stats for target and features
print("Basic Statistics for MVP Votes:")
print(df['if_mvp_votes'].describe())
print("Basic Statistics for Win Percentage:")
print(df['win_pct'].describe())

# Display seasons available in the dataset
print("Season Distribution:")
print(df['season'].value_counts())
Correlation Analysis
{python}
Copy code
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define predictor variables
vars = ['win_pct', 'td:int_90pctile', 'passing_tds_90pctile', 'rushing_tds_90pctile',
        'passing_yards_90pctile', 'passing_first_downs_90pctile', 'pacr_90pctile', 'rushing_yards_90pctile',
        'rushing_first_downs_90pctile', 'total_fumbles_lost_90pctile',
        'sacks_90pctile', 'sack_yards_90pctile', 'interceptions_90pctile']

# Correlation matrix visualization
correlation_matrix = df[vars].corr()
plt.figure(figsize=(15, 10))
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', linewidths=0.5)
plt.title('Correlation Matrix of Variables')
plt.show()
Model Training and Feature Importance
{python}
Copy code
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report
import xgboost as xgb
import numpy as np

# Define predictor variables and target variable
X = df[vars]
y = df['if_mvp_votes']

# Standardize predictor variables
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=23)

# Fit the XGBoost model
xgb_model = xgb.XGBClassifier(use_label_encoder=False, eval_metric='logloss', random_state=23)
xgb_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Show feature importances
feature_importances = pd.DataFrame({'Variable': vars, 'Importance': xgb_model.feature_importances_})
print("Feature Importances:")
display(feature_importances.sort_values(by='Importance', ascending=False))

# Plot feature importances
sns.barplot(x='Importance', y='Variable', data=feature_importances.sort_values(by='Importance', ascending=False))
plt.title('Feature Importances')
plt.xlabel('Importance')
plt.ylabel('Variable')
plt.show()
Model Evaluation
{python}
Copy code
# Predict on the test set
y_pred = xgb_model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
print("Accuracy Score:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print("Confusion Matrix:")
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print("Classification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
MVP Prediction for 2024 Season
{python}
Copy code
# Load the 2024 season data for prediction
df_2024 = pd.read_parquet("data/cleaned_data/season_stats_2024.parquet")
X_current = df_2024[vars]
X_current_scaled = scaler.transform(X_current)

# Predict MVP likelihood for 2024 season
predictions = xgb_model.predict(X_current_scaled)
probabilities = xgb_model.predict_proba(X_current_scaled)[:,1]

# Add predictions to the 2024 dataframe
df_2024['mvp_votes_prediction'] = predictions
df_2024['mvp_votes_probability'] = probabilities

# Display predictions
print("MVP Predictions for 2024 Season:")
display(df_2024[['player_display_name', 'mvp_votes_prediction', 'mvp_votes_probability']])
Summary
In this report, we explored the MVP prediction model using XGBoost. We evaluated the performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other metrics. We also predicted MVP candidates for the 2024 season, identifying those most likely to receive MVP votes.

Tips for Professional Presentation:
Figures and Tables:

Make sure to title each plot and provide labels for axes.
Use plt.show() to include plots inline within the report.
Quarto Format Options:

You can specify output formats (e.g., HTML, PDF) using the YAML header.
Include code-fold: true to allow readers to expand/collapse code blocks for easier navigation.
Narrative:

Add a narrative around each section explaining why the analysis is performed and what insights the results provide.
Markdown Formatting:

Use bullet points, numbered lists, and headers to structure your report.
Add inline math using LaTeX-style syntax (e.g., $y = mx + b$).
HTML/PDF Generation:

To render the .qmd file to an HTML or PDF document, run:
bash
Copy code
quarto render mvp_analysis.qmd
This way, you can generate a professional report that integrates your Python model analysis seamlessly. Let me know if you need further help with setting up Quarto or structuring your document!

I've updated the code to modify the if_mvp column, so that if a player's votes are equal to the highest votes in a given season, if_mvp is set to 1. Let me know if you need any further adjustments or explanations!

show me code to generate a table that includes stats such as 'completion_pct', 'passing_yards', 'passing_tds', 'interceptions', 'passing_air_yards',
    'passing_yards_after_catch', 'sacks', 'total_fumbles_lost', 'passing_first_downs',
    'passing_epa', 'rushing_yards', 'rushing_tds', 'rushing_first_downs'
But includs they'r rank in the dataet for that season
